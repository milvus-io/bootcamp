# Use Milvus in AnythingLLM

[AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) is a powerful, privacy-focused, all-in-one AI desktop application that supports various LLMs, document types, and vector databases. It enables you to build a private, ChatGPT-like assistant that can run locally or be hosted remotely, allowing you to chat intelligently with any documents you provide.

This guide will walk you through configuring Milvus as the vector database in AnythingLLM, enabling you to embed, store, and search your documents for intelligent retrieval and chat.


> This tutorial is based on the official AnythingLLM documentation and real usage steps. If the UI or steps change, please refer to the latest official docs and feel free to suggest improvements.
