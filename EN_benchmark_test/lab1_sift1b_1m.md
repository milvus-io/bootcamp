## 1. Prepare test data and scripts

The one million vectors used in this test are extracted from the dataset [SIFT1B](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/).

#### Hardware requirements

The following configuration has been tested:

| Component           |  Configuration                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Operating System           | Ubuntu LTS 18.04 |
| CPU           | Intel Core i5-8250U           |
| GPU           | NVIDIA GeForce MX150, 2GB GDDR5  |

#### Download test tools

Download the following data and scripts:

- 1 million test data: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XB0u4zDJoF-2E9T5HmoWJQ  Extraction code : zvs4 
- Query data: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LSB167UzUtm1H5Fk91bQfA   Extraction code : imnw 
- Ground truth: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OlFKFoi3zVTr8DZQMoGkJQ Extraction code : 49lg
- Test scripts: [/bootcamp/benchmark_test/scripts/](/benchmark_test/scripts/)

Create a folder named `milvus_sift1m` and move all downloaded files to the folder:

- Unzip the 1 million test data to get the `bvecs_data` folder that contains 10 `npy` files. Each `npy` file contains 100,000 vectors.
- Unzip the query data to get the `query_data` folder that contains `query.npy`, which contains 10,000 vectors to query.
- Unzip the ground truth data to get the gnd folder with `ground_truth_1M.txt`, which contains the locations of top 1000 similar vectors in the query data.
- The test script files contain the following Python scripts: `main.py`、`milvus_toolkit.py`、`milvus_load.py`、`config.py`。

> **Note:** Please go through the README carefully before testing with script . Make changes to the parameters in the script to match your scenario.

## 2. Configure Milvus parameters

To optimize the performance of Milvus, you can change Milvus parameters based on data distribution, performance, and accuracy requirements. In this test, 90% or higher recall rate can be achieved by using the recommended values in the following table.

Configuration file: `/home/$USER/milvus/conf/server_config.yaml`

|         Parameter         | Recommended value |
| ---------------------- | ---- |
|       `cpu_cache_capacity`   |   4   |
|         `gpu_resource_config`.`cache_capacity`      |  1    |
|         `use_blas_threshold`	                |   801     |
|         `gpu_search_threshold`	                |   1001     |
|         `search_resources`	                |   gpu0     |

Refer to [Milvus Configuration](https://github.com/milvus-io/docs/blob/0.7.1/reference/milvus_config.md) for more information.

Use default values for other parameters. After setting parameter values, restart Milvus Docker to apply all changes.

```bash
$ docker restart <container id>
```

## 3. Create a table and build indexes

Make sure Milvus is already installed and started. (For details of Milvus installation, please read [Milvus Quick Start](https://milvus.io/docs/v0.8.0/guides/get_started/install_milvus/gpu_milvus_docker.md)).

>  Before testing, please modify the corresponding parameters according to the [script instructions](/benchmark_test/scripts/README.md)


Go to `milvus_sift1m`, and run the following command to create a table and build indexes:

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection ann_1m_sq8 --dim 128 -c
$ python3 main.py --collection ann_1m_sq8 --index sq8 --build 
```

Vectors are then inserted into a table named `ann_1m_sq8h`, with the index_type of `IVF_SQ8H`. 

To show the available tables and number of vectors in each table, use the following command:

```bash
#查看库中有哪些表
$ python3 main.py --show
#查看表ann_1m_sq8h的行数
$ python3 main.py --collection ann_1m_sq8 --rows
#查看表ann_1m_sq8h的索引类型
$ python3 main.py --collection ann_1m_sq8 --describe_index
```

## 4.  Import data

Make sure table ann_1m_sq8 is successfully created.

Run the following command to import 1,000,000 rows of data:

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection=ann_1m_sq8 --load
```

You can see that all data is imported from the file for once.

Run the following command to check the number of rows in the table:

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection=ann_1m_sq8 --rows
```

To make sure that all data imported to Milvus has indexes built. Navigate to `/home/$USER/milvus/db` and enter the following command:

```bash
$ sqlite3 meta.sqlite
```

In sqlite3 CLI, enter the following command to check the current status:

```sql
sqlite> select * from TableFiles where table_id='ann_1m_sq8h';
```

Milvus divides a vector table into shards for storage. So, a query returns multiple records. The third column specifies the index type and 5 stands for IVF_SQ8H. The fifth column specifies the build status of the index and 3 indicates that index building is complete for the shard. If index building is not complete for a specific shard, you can manually build indexes for the shard.

Exit sqlite CLI:

```sql
sqlite> .quit
```

Enter `milvus_sift1m` and run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection=ann_1m_sq8 --index=sq8 --build 
```

After manually building indexes, enter sqlite CLI again and make sure that index building has been completed for all shards. To understand the meanings of other columns, navigate to `/home/$USER/milvus/db` and enter the following command in the sqlite CLI:

```bash
$ sqlite3 meta.sqlite
sqlite>.schema
```

## 5. Accuracy test

SIFT1B provides not only the vector dataset to search 10,000 vectors, but also the top 1000 ground truth for each vector, which allows convenient calculation of precision rate. The vector search accuracy of Milvus can be represented as follows:

Accuracy = Number of shared vectors (between Milvus search results and Ground truth) / (query_records * top_k)

####  Run query script

Before the accuracy test, you need to manually create the directory `recall_result / recall_compare_out` to save the test results. To test the search precision for  top1(top10, top100, top200) results of 500 vectors randomly chosen from the 10,000 query vectors, go to directory `milvus_sift1m`, and run this command:

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection=ann_1m_sq8 --search_param 128 --recall
```

> Note: search_param is nprobe value. nprobe affects search accuracy and performance. The greater the value, the higher the accuracy, but the lower the performance. In this experiment.

After executing the above command, an `ann_sift1m_sq8_128_500_recall.txt` text file will be generated in the` recall_result` folder. The text file records the id and distance of the most similar first 200 vectors corresponding to 500 vectors,Every 200 lines in the text file correspond to a query result of a query. At the same time, multiple texts will be generated under the `recall_compare_out` file. Taking ` ann_sift1m_sq8_128_500_100` as an example, this text records the respective corresponding accuracy rates and the total average accuracy rate of the 500 vectors queried when topk = 100.

The accuracy rate has a positive correlation with search parameter `nprobe` (number of sub-spaces searched). In this test, when the `nprobe` = 64, the accuracy can reach > 90%.  However, as the `nprobe` gets bigger, the search time will be longer. 

Therefore, based on your data distribution and business scenario, you need to edit `nprobe` to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and search time. 

## 6. Performance test

To test search performance, go to directory *milvus_sift1m*, and run the following script: 

```bash
$ python3 main.py --collection=ann_1m_sq8 --search_param 128 --performance
```

When the execution is completed, a `performance` folder is generated and includes `ann_1m_sq8h_32_output.csv`, which includes the running time for topk values with different nq values.

- nq - the number of query vectors
- topk - the top k most similar vectors for the query vectors 
- total_time - the total query elapsed time (in seconds)
- avg_time - the average time to query one vector (in seconds)

**Note:**

> 1. In milvus_toolkit.py, `nq` is set to be 1, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, respectively, and `topk` is set to be 1, 20, 50, 100, 300, 500, 800, 1000, respectively.
>
> 2. To run the first vector search, some extra time is needed to load the data (from the disk) to the memory.
>
> 3. It is recommended to run several performance tests continuously, and use the search time of the second run. If the tests are executed intermittently, Intel CPU may downgrade to base clock speed.
