# Contributing to Milvus Bootcamp

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Milvus Bootcamp. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.



## 🔎 What should I know before I get started?

- Milvus Bootcamp design decision

  [Milvus Bootcamp](https://github.com/milvus-io/bootcamp) is designed to expose users to both the simplicity and depth of the [**Milvus**](https://milvus.io/) vector database. Discover how to run **benchmark tests** as well as build similarity search applications spanning **chatbots**, **recommendation systems**, **reverse image search**, **molecular search**, **video search**, **audio saerch**, and more.

  Each solution in Bootcamp contains a **Jupyter Notebook** and a **Docker deployable solution**, meaning anyone can run it on their local machine.

- The code structure

  For each Docker deployable solution, you can learn the code structure and then modify the code to contribute.

  ```bash
  └───server
  │   │   Dockerfile
  │   │   requirements.txt  # Python requirement library
  │   │   main.py  # File for starting the server.
  │   │
  │   └───src
  │       │   config.py  # Configuration file.
  │       │   encode.py  # Covert image/video/text/... to embeddings.
  │       │   milvus.py  # Milvus related functions such as insert/query vectors etc.
  │       │   mysql.py   # Mysql related functions such as add/delete/query IDs and object information.
  │       │   
  │       └───operations # Call methods in server to insert/query/delete data.
  │               │   insert.py
  │               │   query.py
  │               │   delete.py
  │               │   count.py
  ```
