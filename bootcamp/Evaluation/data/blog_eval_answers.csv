[1, 65535] 2 IVF_SQ8 IVF_FLAT does not perform any compression, so the index files it produces are roughly the same size as the original, raw non-indexed vector data. For example, if the original 1B SIFT dataset is 476 GB, its IVF_FLAT index files will be slightly smaller (~470 GB). Loading all the index files into memory will consume 470 GB of storage. When disk, CPU, or GPU memory resources are limited, IVF_SQ8 is a better option than IVF_FLAT. This index type can convert each FLOAT (4 bytes) to UINT8 (1 byte) by performing Scalar Quantization (SQ). This reduces disk, CPU, and GPU memory consumption by 70—75%.

Instead of calculating the distances between the target vector and the center of all the units, product quantization enables the calculation of distances between the target vector and the clustering center of each low-dimensional space and greatly reduces the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

You can tailor the indexing process for specific fields by adjusting their metric_type and index_type. For the vector field, you have the flexibility to select COSINE, L2, or IP as the metric_type. Python Java Node.js The code snippet above demonstrates how to set up index parameters for the vector field and a scalar field, respectively. For","The default AUTOINDEX index in Milvus is IVF_SQ8, and the default vector field distance metric is L2 (Euclidean distance).",The default `AUTOINDEX` index type uses L2 (Euclidean) as its distance metric for vectors.,The default distance metric for vector fields is L2.,Milvus uses COSINE as the default distance metric for vector fields.,The default distance metric for vector fields is L2.,The default distance metric for vector fields is IP (Inner Product).
