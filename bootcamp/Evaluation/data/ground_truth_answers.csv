What do the parameters for HNSW mean?,"* M: maximum degree, or number of connections a node can have in the graph.  It affects the trade-off between search quality and memory consumption.
* efConstruction: number of nearest neighbors to consider when constructing nodes in a graph.
* ef: number of nearest neighbors to consider when searching for closest vectors in a graph layer. Higher values of either efConstruction or ef can improve recall rate at the cost of increased build or search time.
","In order to improve performance, HNSW limits the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph to M. In addition, you can use efConstruction (when building index) or ef (when searching targets) to specify a search range.

What does nlist vs nprobe mean in ivf_flat?,"# nlist:  controls how the vector data is partitioned into clusters during indexing.  # nprobe:  how many of those clusters are searched during a query. Set nlist to around 4 * sqrt(n), where n is the total number of vectors. nprobe requires tuning to balance accuracy and performance based on the dataset characteristics.","IVF_FLAT divides vector data into nlist cluster units, and then compares distances between the target input vector and the center of each cluster. Depending on the number of clusters the system is set to query (nprobe), similarity search results are returned based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the most similar cluster(s) only – drastically reducing query time.","performance can be improved with minimal impact on accuracy. [0, 1] FAQ What is the difference between FLAT index and IVF_FLAT index? IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike","""nlist"" refers to the number of cluster units or partitions into which data is divided. ""nprobe"" indicates the number of these clusters that are queried during a search. Essentially, nlist determines how finely data is partitioned, while nprobe controls how many partitions are searched to find approximate nearest neighbors.","`nlist` and `nprobe` are two distinct parameters that control the trade-off between search speed and recall.  **`nlist`**: This parameter controls the number of cluster units (also called ""centroids"" or ""codewords"") used to represent the index. Think of it as the granularity of the clustering. A higher value for `nlist` means more clusters, which can improve search recall but increase indexing time and memory usage.  **`nprobe`**: This parameter controls the number of units (or centroids) to query during search. It determines how many ""closest"" cluster centers to consider when searching for nearest neighbors. A higher value for `nprobe` means more probes, which can improve search accuracy at the expense of increased computation time and memory usage.  To summarize:  * `nlist` controls the number of clusters (index units) in the index. * `nprobe` controls the number of cluster centers to query during search.  For example, if you set `nlist=128` and `nprobe=8`, the index will use 128 clusters to represent the data, and during search, it will consider 8 closest cluster centers to find the nearest neighbors.","`nlist` and `nprobe` are two distinct parameters.  `nlist` refers to the number of cluster units or the number of centroids in the index.
