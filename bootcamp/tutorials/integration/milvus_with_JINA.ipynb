    "## Milvus and Jina AI's Embedding\n",
    "In order to store and search these embeddings efficiently for speed and scale, specific infrastructure designed for this purpose is required. Milvus is a widely known advanced open-source vector database capable of handling large-scale vector data. Milvus enables fast and accurate vector(embedding) search according plenty of metrics. Its scalability allows for seamless handling of massive volumes of image data, ensuring high-performance search operations even as datasets grow. "
