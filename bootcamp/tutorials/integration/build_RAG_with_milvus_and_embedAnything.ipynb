    "# Building RAG with Milvus and EmbedAnything\n",
    "\n",
    "[EmbedAnything](https://github.com/StarlightSearch/EmbedAnything) is a blazing-fast, lightweight embedding pipeline built in Rust that supports text, PDFs, images, audio, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using EmbedAnything together with [Milvus](https://milvus.io). Rather than tightly coupling with any specific database, EmbedAnything uses a pluggable **adapter** system — adapters serve as wrappers that define how embeddings are formatted, indexed, and stored in the target vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "By pairing EmbedAnything with a Milvus adapter, you can generate embeddings from diverse file types and efficiently store them in Milvus in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ Note: While the adapter in EmbedAnything handles insertion into Milvus, it does not support search out of the box. To build a full RAG pipeline, you’ll also need to instantiate a MilvusClient separately and implement the retrieval logic (e.g., similarity search over vectors) as part of your application."
