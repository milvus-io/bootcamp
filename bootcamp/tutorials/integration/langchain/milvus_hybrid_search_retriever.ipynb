    "# Hybrid Search with Milvus and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search combines the strengths of different search paradigms to enhance retrieval accuracy and robustness. It leverages the capabilities of both dense vector search and sparse vector search, as well as combinations of multiple dense vector search strategies, ensuring comprehensive and precise retrieval for diverse queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../../images/advanced_rag/hybrid_and_rerank.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the most common hybrid search scenario, which is the dense + sparse hybrid search. In this case, candidates are retrieved using both semantic vector similarity and precise keyword matching. Results from these methods are merged, reranked, and passed to an LLM to generate the final answer. This approach balances precision and semantic understanding, making it highly effective for diverse query scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to dense + sparse hybrid search, hybrid strategies can also combine multiple dense vector models. For instance, one dense vector model might specialize in capturing semantic nuances, while another focuses on contextual embeddings or domain-specific representations. By merging results from these models and reranking them, this type of hybrid search ensures a more nuanced and context-aware retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain Milvus integration provides a flexible way to implement hybrid search, it supports any number of vector fields, and any custom dense or sparse embedding models, which allows LangChain Milvus to flexibly adapt to various hybrid search usage scenarios, and at the same time compatible with other capabilities of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start with the most common dense + sparse case, and then introduce any number of general hybrid search usage approachs.\n"

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#')"
