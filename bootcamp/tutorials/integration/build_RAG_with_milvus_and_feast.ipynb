    "# Build RAG with Milvus and Feast\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using [Feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) and [Milvus](https://milvus.io/). Feast is an open-source feature store that streamlines feature management for machine learning, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of structured data for both training and real-time inference. Milvus is a high-performance vector database designed for fast similarity search, making it ideal for retrieving relevant documents in RAG workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we'll use Feast to inject documents and structured data (i.e., features) into the context of an LLM (Large Language Model) to power a RAG Application (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Milvus as the online vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why [Feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Feast solves several common issues in this flow:\n",
    "1. **Online retrieval:** At inference time, LLMs often need access to data that isn't readily \n",
    "   available and needs to be precomputed from other data sources.\n",
    "   * Feast manages deployment to a variety of online stores (e.g. Milvus, DynamoDB, Redis, Google Cloud Datastore) and \n",
    "     ensures necessary features are consistently _available_ and _freshly computed_ at inference time.\n",
    "2. **Vector Search:** Feast has built support for vector similarity search that is easily configured declaritively so users can focus on their application. Milvus provides powerful and efficient vector similarity search capabilities.\n",
    "3. **Richer structured data:** Along with vector search, users can query standard structured fields to inject into the LLM context for better user experiences.\n",
    "4. **Feature/Context and versioning:** Different teams within an organization are often unable to reuse \n",
    "   data across projects and services, resulting in duplicate application logic. Models have data dependencies that need \n",
    "   to be versioned, for example when running A/B tests on model/prompt versions.\n",
    "   * Feast enables discovery of and collaboration on previously used documents, features, and enables versioning of sets of \n",
    "     data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Deploy a local feature store with a **Parquet file offline store** and **Milvus online store**.\n",
    "2. Write/materialize the data (i.e., feature values) from the offline store (a parquet file) into the online store (Milvus).\n",
    "3. Serve the features using the Feast SDK with Milvus's vector search capabilities\n",
    "4. Inject the document into the LLM's context to answer questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial is based on the official Milvus integration guide from the [Feast Repository](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/blob/master/examples/rag/milvus-quickstart.ipynb). While we strive to keep this tutorial up-to-date, if you encounter any discrepancies, please refer to the official guide and feel free to open an issue in our repository for any necessary updates."

The city comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county. New York is a global center of finance and commerce, culture and technology, entertainment and media, academics and scientific output, and the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, is an important center for international diplomacy. New York City is the epicenter of the world's principal metropolitan economy.\n",
      "With an estimated population in 2022 of 8,335,897 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city. New York is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With more than 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities. The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. In 2021, the city was home to nearly 3.1 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.\n",
      "New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. before being permanently renamed New York in November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island, and has been the largest U.S. city ever since.\n",
      "Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's premier financial and fintech center and the most economically powerful city in the world. As of 2022, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were its own country, it would have the tenth-largest economy in the world. The city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors. As of 2023, New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates to live. New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires, individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million), and millionaires of any city in the world.}\n",
