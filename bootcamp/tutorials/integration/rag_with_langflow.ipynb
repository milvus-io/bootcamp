    "# Building a RAG System Using Langflow with Milvus\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to use [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/) to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with [Milvus](https://milvus.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG system enhances text generation by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and then generating new responses based on this context. Milvus is used to store and retrieve text embeddings, while Langflow facilitates the integration of retrieval and generation in a visual workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langflow enables easy construction of RAG pipelines, where chunks of text are embedded, stored in Milvus, and retrieved when relevant queries are made. This allows the language model to generate contextually informed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milvus serves as a scalable vector database that quickly finds semantically similar text, while Langflow allows you to manage how your pipeline handles text retrieval and response generation. Together, they provide an efficient way to build a robust RAG pipeline for enhanced text-based applications."

    "3. Link the Milvus Modules to the rest of the components. See the image below for reference.\n",
    "4. Configure the Milvus credentials for both Milvus modules. The simplest way is to use Milvus Lite by setting Connection URI to milvus_demo.db. If you have a Milvus server self-deployed or on Zilliz Cloud, set the Connection URI to server endpoint and Connection Password to token (for Milvus that's concatenated \"<username>:<password>\", for Zilliz Cloud it's API Key).
