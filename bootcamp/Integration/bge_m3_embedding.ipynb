    "# Using BGE M3-Embedding Model with Milvus\n",
    "\n",
    "As Deep Neural Networks continue to advance rapidly, it's increasingly common to employ them for information representation and retrieval. Referred to as embedding models, they can encode information into dense or sparse vector representations within a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 30, 2024, a new member called BGE-M3 was released as part of the BGE model series. The M3 represents its capabilities in supporting over 100 languages, accommodating input lengths of up to 8192, and incorporating multiple functions such as dense, lexical, and multi-vec/colbert retrieval into a unified system. BGE-M3 holds the distinction of being the first embedding model to offer support for all three retrieval methods, resulting in achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-lingual (MIRACL) and cross-lingual (MKQA) benchmark tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milvus, world's first open-source vector database, plays a vital role in semantic search with efficient storage and retrieval for vector embeddings. Its scalability and advanced functionalities, such as metadata filtering, further contribute to its significance in this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use **BGE M3 embedding model with Milvus** for semantic similarity search.\n",

    "## Preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate with `BAAI/bge-m3` model and Milvus in Standalone mode. The text for searching comes from the [M3 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03216.pdf). For each sentence in the paper, we use `BAAI/bge-m3` model to convert the text string into 1024 dimension vector embedding, and store each embedding in Milvus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then search a query by converting the query text into a vector embedding, and perform vector Approximate Nearest Neighbor search to find the text strings with cloest semantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this demo, be sure you have already [started up a Milvus instance](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) and installed python packages `pymilvus` (Milvus client library) and `FlagEmbedding` (library for BGE models)."
