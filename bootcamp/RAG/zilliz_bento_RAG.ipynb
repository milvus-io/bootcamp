Within the API endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`, it is loading the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model from Hugging Face and will use it to create embeddings.\n",

    "## A RAG Example\n",
    "Now we’re ready. It’s time to ask a question. We can probably do this without creating a function, but making a function makes it nice and repeatable. This function simply intakes a question and then does RAG to answer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by embedding the question using the same embedding model we used to embed the documents. Next, we execute a search on Zilliz Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we pass the question into the `get_embeddings` function in list format, and then pass the outputted list directly into the `data` section of our Zilliz Cloud search. This is because of the way that the function signatures are set up; it’s easier to reuse them than rewrite multiple functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside our search call, we also need to provide a few more parameters. `anns_field` tells Zilliz Cloud which field to do an approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we also pass a `limit` parameter which tells us how many results to get back from Zilliz Cloud. For this example, we can just go with five.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last search parameter defines which fields we want back from our search. For this example, we can just get the `sentence`, which is the field we used to store our chunk of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our search results back, we need to process them. Zilliz Cloud returns an entity with `hits` in it, so we grab the “sentence” from all five hits and join them with a period so it forms a list paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we pass the question that the user asked along with the context into the `dorag` function we created above and return the response."

We used BentoML’s serving capabilities to serve an embedding model endpoint and LLM endpoints to access an open source model and Zilliz Cloud as our vector database.\n",

    "We used a simple method to chunk up our data, which was scraped from Wikipedia. Then, we took those chunks and passed them to our embedding model, hosted on BentoML, to get the vector embeddings to put into Zilliz Cloud. With all of the vector embeddings in Zilliz Cloud, we were fully set to do RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM we chose this time was the `Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model, one of many open source models available on BentoML. We created two functions to enable RAG: one function that passed in the question and context to the LLM; and another function that embedded the user question, searched Zilliz Cloud and then passed in the search results along with the question to the original RAG function. At the end, we tested our RAG with a simple question as a sanity check."
