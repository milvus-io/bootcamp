Retrieval is at the heart of RAG solution, which typically involves maintaining a knowledge base with document parsing and chunking, hosting an embedding model and using vector database as retrieval engine. With Zilliz Cloud Pipelines, you don't need to deal with such a complex tech stack. Everything can be done with an API call.\n",

This function maps an input field (doc_url) to four output fields (doc_name, chunk_id, chunk_text, and embedding) in the auto-generated collection.\n",
    "- The `PRESERVE` function stores a user-defined input as additional [scalar](https://milvus.io/docs/scalar_index.md) field in the auto-generated collection. This is typically used to store meta information of the document, such as publisher info, tags that describes the property of the file.\n",
