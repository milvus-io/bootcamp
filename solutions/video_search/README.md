# Building a video search system based on Milvus

- In this [notebook](TUTORIAL.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform reverse image search. This example uses a ResNet model to extract image features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

- Here is the [quick start](QUICK_START.md) for a deployable version of a reverse image search.
