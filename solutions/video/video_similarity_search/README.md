# Video search system based on Milvus

## Try notebook

- In this [notebook](1_reverse_video_search_engine.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform similar video search. This example uses Towhee to extract video features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 
If you want to learn how to reduce resource usage, speed up system, and ensure stability, you can refer [this link](https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/blob/main/video/reverse_video_search/2_deep_dive_reverse_video_search.ipynb)

## How to Deploy

- Here is the [quick start](quick_deploy) for a deployable version of a similar video search system.
- In addition, there is [quick start](object_detection) about video object detection.
