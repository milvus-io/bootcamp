# Video search system based on Milvus

## Try notebook

- In this [notebook](video_similarity_search.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform similar video search. This example uses a VGG model to extract image features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

## How to Deploy

- Here is the [quick start](quick_deploy) for a deployable version of a similar video search system.
- In addition, there is [quick start](object_detection) about video object detection.
