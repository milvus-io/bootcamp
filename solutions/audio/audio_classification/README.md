# Audio Classification

Audio classification predicts a label given an audio input. This label is a pre-defined name of class or category.

This audio classification bootcamp mainly includes notebooks for difference scenarios. You can learn about audio classification solutions and basic concepts of [Towhee](https://towhee.io/) and [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) from these notebook tutorials.

## Learn from Notebook

- [Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/tree/main/audio/audio_classification/music_genre_classification.ipynb)

In this notebook, you will build a basic music genre classification system with sample data (300 audio files of 10 classes), visualize predicted labels, and measure the system with performance metrics. At the end, you are able to build up a playable music genre classification system with a simple interface.
