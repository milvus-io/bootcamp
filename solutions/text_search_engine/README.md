# Text Search Engine
Text search is a very important part of a search engine.  Text search engine refers to searching a collection of text based on its content, such as keywords, semantics, etc.
This example uses Milvus and Bert to build a text search engine, which uses Bert to convert text into vectors and store them in Milvus, and then combines Milvus to search for text that is similar to the input text.


## Try notebook
- In this [notebook](text_search_engine.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform the text search engine .This example combines a relational database, Postgres, and then uses it with Milvus for text search.

## How to deploy
- Here is the [quick start](./quick_deploy/README.md) for a deployable version of  text search engine.
