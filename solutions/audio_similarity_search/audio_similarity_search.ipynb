    "### Processing and Storing Audio Files\n",
    "In order to store the audio tracks in Milvus, we must first get the embeddings. To do this, we start by loading the audio file using Librosa. Once we have the audio clip loaded we can pass it to the PANN model. In this case we are using the panns_inference library to simplfy the importing and processing. Once we recieve the embedding we can push it into Milvus and store each uniqueID and filepath combo into redis. We do this so that we can later access the audio file when displaying the results. "
