# Image Similarity Search
Image search is one of the core ideas behind many different technologies, from autonomous cars recognizing objects to iPhones recognizing the correct user. Here you will find how one can easily empower their vision programs using Milvus.

## Try notebook
In this [notebook](image_similarity_search.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform reverse image search. This example uses a ResNet model to extract image features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

## How to Deploy
Here is the [quick start](./quick_deploy/QUICK_START.md) for a deployable version of a reverse image search.
