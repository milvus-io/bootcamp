    "# HDBSCAN Clustering with Milvus\n",
    "Data can be transformed into embeddings using deep learning models, which capture meaningful representations of the original data. By applying an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we can group similar data points together based on their inherent patterns. HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a widely used clustering algorithm that efficiently groups data points by analyzing their density and distance. It is particularly useful for discovering clusters of varying shapes and sizes. In this notebook, we will use HDBSCAN with Milvus, a high-performance vector database, to cluster data points into distinct groups based on their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that relies on calculating distances between data points in embedding space. These embeddings, created by deep learning models, represent data in a high-dimensional form. To group similar data points, HDBSCAN determines their proximity and density, but efficiently computing these distances, especially for large datasets, can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milvus, a high-performance vector database, optimizes this process by storing and indexing embeddings, allowing for fast retrieval of similar vectors. When used together, HDBSCAN and Milvus enable efficient clustering of large-scale datasets in embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the BGE-M3 embedding model to extract embeddings from a news headline dataset, utilize Milvus to efficiently calculate distances between embeddings to aid HDBSCAN in clustering, and then visualize the results for analysis using the UMAP method. This notebook is a Milvus adapation of [Dylan Castillo's article](https://dylancastillo.co/posts/clustering-documents-with-openai-langchain-hdbscan.html)."
