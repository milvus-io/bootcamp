    "# Graph RAG with Milvus\n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread application of large language models highlights the importance of improving the accuracy and relevance of their responses. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances models with external knowledge bases, providing more contextual information and mitigating issues like hallucination and insufficient knowledge. However, relying solely on simple RAG paradigms has its limitations, especially when dealing with complex entity relationships and multi-hop questions, where the model often struggles to provide accurate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing knowledge graphs (KGs) into the RAG system offers a new solution. KGs present entities and their relationships in a structured way, providing more precise retrieval information and helping RAG to better handle complex question-answering tasks. KG-RAG is still in its early stages, and there is no consensus on how to effectively retrieve entities and relationships from KGs or how to integrate vector similarity search with graph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce a simple yet powerful approach to greatly improve the performance of this scenario. It is a simple RAG paradigm with multi-way retrieval and then reranking, but it implements Graph RAG logically, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling multi-hop questions. Let's see how it is implemented."
