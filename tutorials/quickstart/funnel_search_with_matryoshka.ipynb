    "When building efficient vector search systems, one key challenge is managing storage costs while maintaining acceptable latency and recall. Modern embedding models output vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions, creating significant storage and computational overhead for the raw vector and index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the storage requirements are reduced by applying a quantization or dimensionality reduction method just before building the index. For instance, we can save storage by lowering the precision using Product Quantization (PQ) or the number of dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These methods analyze the entire vector set to find a more compact one that maintains the semantic relationships between vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While effective, these standard approaches reduce precision or dimensionality only once and at a single scale. But what if we could maintain multiple layers of detail simultaneously, like a pyramid of increasingly precise representations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Matryoshka embeddings. Named after Russian nesting dolls (see illustration), these clever constructs embed multiple scales of representation within a single vector. Unlike traditional post-processing methods, Matryoshka embeddings learn this multi-scale structure during the initial training process. The result is remarkable: not only does the full embedding capture input semantics, but each nested subset prefix (first half, first quarter, etc.) provides a coherent, if less detailed, representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we examine how to use Matryoshka embeddings with Milvus for semantic search. We illustrate an algorithm called \"funnel search\" that allows us to perform similarity search over a small subset of our embedding dimensions without a drastic drop in recall."

Finally, we discussed how the order of the dimensions is important when forming sub-embeddings - it must be in the same way for which the model was trained. Or rather, it is only because the model was trained in a certain way that prefixes of the embeddings are meaningful. Now you know how to implement Matryoshka embeddings and funnel search to reduce the storage costs of semantic search without sacrificing too much retrieval performance!"
